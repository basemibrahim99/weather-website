This is a fully functioning live weather web application written in JavaScript.\
It can be accessed through this URL: https://ibra-weather-application.herokuapp.com/

## How to Use
  - The web app has three tabs, Weather, About and Help.
  - The Weather tab is the main tab in which you use to retrieve the weather.
    - In the textbox, simply enter the name of location in which you would like to recieve the current weather for.

## How it Works
  - Used the Weather Stack and Geocode APIs to create a weather app that fetches live weather feed for the user upon an inputted location.
  - The backend of this application uses Node to make HTTP Requests to the two APIs in use.
